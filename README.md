## 🌟 What is EduMatcher?

EduMatcher is an LLM-based app that helps international students find suitable university programs using natural language.
It combines structured filtering with semantic search and GPT-generated explanations to provide meaningful recommendations.

Match those preferences with real university programs using vector similarity (OpenAI + FAISS).
Generate custom explanation texts with GPT-4 for each recommendation.
Handle vague, fuzzy, or missing inputs with fallback logic.
